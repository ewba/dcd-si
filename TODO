"It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.” -- Antoine de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes

The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge attack surface full of mediocre code.

• Some plain scientific facts
• A new laptop + screen costs 691kg CO2e/year, on a 4 year renewal policy (source oxford https://www.it.ox.ac.uk/article/environment-and-it)
• 85% of it is manufacturing => 588kg CO2e/year just for having a new-ish laptop
• Keep your laptop/screen 8 years, it now only costs 290 kg CO2e/year
Your new laptop isn't green...
...but the longer you keep your laptop, the greener it becomes

Harsh scientific facts again
• Laptop mean power consumption is constant over a 8-year course. (and probably under-estimated)
(source: Computer usage and national energy consumption: Results from a field-metering study (2014))
• CPU accounts for less than 20% of total consumption - Moore's law is of little use in this case
• OLED has still a very low market share, so your next laptop will probably still be LCD. It costs more CO2e to build, anyway….
• Energy consumption accounts for 15% of the CO2e anyway, so...
